I really like its concept of interleaving text with programs. I always think programs are superior in terms of understandability than bare math equations. After all, you can debug, step through and substitute inputs with a program, the experience is very interactive. Having a runnable program is like giving a kid a clock to dissemble and reassemble it back to figure out how the clock works. Whereas providing just the equations is like providing only the blueprints of that clock. I seriously believe equations and math symbols were optimized for write and derive on paper, it's not an user friendly form for reading and understanding. For example, math equations tend to use single character symbols followed by a paragraph to explain what those symbols mean and often the authors are too lazy to cover each of them.

Epiphany is our response to the recent trends in content consuming, where people spend less time with traditional media, such as books, while spending more time consuming information on line. This trend can attribute to a few unique benefits of on-line contents. For example, on-line contents are often bite sized tailored for people's increasingly fragmented time.
